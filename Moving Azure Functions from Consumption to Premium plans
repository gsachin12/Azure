Moving Azure Functions from Consumption to Premium plans


This is a quick post on how we can change the Plan Type of an Azure Function App from Consumption (Serverless) to a Premium Plan. 
If you have created an Azure Function App initially selecting Consumption (Serverless) as the plan type and 
then later if you want to change it to a Premium Plan, Azure Portal has no direct way to do it.


Here you have 2 options,

1.Create a new Azure Function App with a Premium plan and redeploy code
2.Create a new Azure Function Premium Plan and change the existing Function App to use the new plan through Azure CLI

The first option can be a pain, you basically need to setup everything and deploy the code. The second option is pretty easy.

The Second option First, we need to create a new Azure Function Premium Plan.

$resourceGroup = 'functionapp_rg'
$functionAppName = 'FunctionAppDLLMS'
$consumptionPlanName = 'FunctionAppDLLMSPlan'
$premiumPlanName = 'premium_plan_name'


--sku <EP1 or EP2 or EP3> 
--is-linux true by default windows

Command:
az functionapp plan create --name $premiumPlanName --sku EP1 --resource-group $resourceGroup --location 'Central india'

In the step 2, we move our Function app to the Premium plan with the following 
command:
az functionapp update --name $functionAppName --resource-group $resourceGroup --plan $premiumPlanName
